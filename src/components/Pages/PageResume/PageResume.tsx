						<p>&emsp;&emsp;I am a self-taught programmer from Windsor, Canada. Interested in computers and technology since I was a little child; I went into Film and Television production naturally. I enjoyed the technical aspects of production; mostly camera operation and editing. They both gave me the ability to express myself artistically, while still adhering to conventions (and knowing when to buck conventions) to produce something that was uniquely me.</p>
						<p>&emsp;&emsp;However, the job I got out of college involved none of that. I did get to work in a fast-paced office environment. Working on large-scale projects Quality-Controlling and encoding video for {linker('Crave.ca', 'https:crave.ca')} (Service not available outside of Canada) for almost 8 years.</p>
						<p>&emsp;&emsp;I had started to learn {linkSM('c++')} programming around 2016. Creating two functional programs that my department used to allow a more efficient workflow.</p>
						<em className='note'>(Due to creating the applications for a private corporation, I do not own the own code for these, and cannot share the github links)</em>
						<p>&emsp;&emsp;The first was a {linkSM('cli')} (Command Line Interface) to work with a proprietary application we used to Quality Control assets. Eventually being reworked as a {linkSM('qt')} {linkSM('gui')} application as that proprietary app and workflow became more complex. The other being a QT GUI application for file manipulation, as there was a lot of manual changing of file structures.</p>
						<p>&emsp;&emsp;While working for {linker('Bell Media Canada', 'https://www.bellmedia.ca/')}, I met my lovely wife Lucy; who has lived in Ohio her whole life. We got married in November of 2019 in Toledo, Ohio and started immigration procedures. 2 years later, while during a pandemic, I was able to {linker('immigrate', 'https://www.dhs.gov/get-green-card#:~:text=A%20Green%20Card%20holder%20is,called%20a%20%22Green%20Card.%22')} to the United States of America with my wife. While getting settled, I got a part-time job at {linker(`Graeter's Ice Cream`, 'https://www.graeters.com/')} here in Columbus, Ohio. A great place that helped hone my ability to deal with the general public while completing orders and going above and beyond with both customers and the needs of the store.</p>
						<p>&emsp;&emsp;While working at Graeter's, I learned web development with the help of my {linker('best friend', 'https://www.linkedin.com/mwlite/in/eric-sartor-21867616a')}; a software developer. Who works at Bell Media, in Canada.</p>
						<p className={`${classes.endAbout} note`}>Now, I'm looking for an employer who wants a self-starting, smart, adaptable junior web developer to grow and learn with.</p>

However, that within the structures of how to do something, there was always some creativity that goes into technical work. I learned from school that there is imagination and creativity in technical work; and that was the type of creativity I was really good with.</li>
